## Part 1: Healthy
When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

__Strong Views, Loosely Held__  
Most people go through life and never develop strong views on things.
What happens when the world changes? What happens when something else happens? That's where "loosely held" comes in.

The key to success is, "Be so good they can't ignore you."

Warren Buffett, he's betting against change. We're betting for change. When he makes a mistake, it's because something changes that he didn't expect. When we make a mistake, it's because something doesn't change that we thought would.

To do original work: It's not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe.

### Arnold Schwarzenegger

### Derek Sivers
Because most of us say yes to too much stuff, and then, we let these little, mediocre things fill our lives... The problem is, when that occasional, 'Oh my God, hell yeah!' things comes along, you don't have enough time to give it the attention that you should, because you've said yes to too much other little, half-ass stuff, right?

Stressed is the achiever word for fear.

__The Best Investment He's ever made?__  
Warren Buffett told him, "In vesting in yourself is the most important investment you'll ever make in your life... There's no financial investment that'll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, that's what's going to really provide economic freedom..."

Jim Rohn famously said, "If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy."

__Quality Questions Create a Quality Life__  
The quality of your life is the quality of your questions. Questions determine your focus.

## Casey Neistat
If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.
    -- Ben Franklin

## Reid Hoffman
The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein

If they don't just accept the strategy you hand them, they should suggest modifications to the plan based on their closeness to the details.

## Peter Thiel
I think, once you have a trend, you have many people doing it. And once you have many people doing something, you have lots of competition and little differentiation.

Not everybody should do the same thing. There is something very odd about a society where the most talented people all get tracked toward the same elite colleges, where they end up studying the same small number of subjects and going into the same small number of careers.

Are you going to college because it's a 4-year party? Is it a consumption decision? Is it an investment decision where you're investing in your future? Is it insurance? Or is it a tournament where you're just beating other people?
