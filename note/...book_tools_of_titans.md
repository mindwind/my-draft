__Strong Views, Loosely Held__  
Most people go through life and never develop strong views on things.
What happens when the world changes? What happens when something else happens? That's where "loosely held" comes in.

The key to success is, "Be so good they can't ignore you."

Warren Buffett, he's betting against change. We're betting for change. When he makes a mistake, it's because something changes that he didn't expect. When we make a mistake, it's because something doesn't change that we thought would.

To do original work: It's not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe.

### Arnold Schwarzenegger
I am a big believer that if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier.

Because most of us say yes to too much stuff, and then, we let these little, mediocre things fill our lives...

__The Best Investment He's ever made?__  
Warren Buffett told him, "In vesting in yourself is the most important investment you'll ever make in your life...

Jim Rohn famously said, "If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy."

__Quality Questions Create a Quality Life__  
The quality of your life is the quality of your questions. Questions determine your focus.
