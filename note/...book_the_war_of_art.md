## What I Do
How many pages have I produced? I don't care. Are they any good? I don't even think about it. All that matters is I've put in my time and hit it with all I've got. All that counts is that, for this day, for this session, I have overcome Resistance.


## What I Know
There's secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the the secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.
What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.


## BOOK ONE - Resistance - Defining the Enemy


## BOOK TWO - Combating Resistance - Turning Pro

Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. "I Write only when inspiration strikes," he replied. "Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp."

## A Professional Dedicates Himself To Mastering Technique

## YOU, INC.
If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves. We're less subjective. We don't take blows as personally.


## BOOK THREE - Beyond Resistance - The Higher Realm
## Approaching The Mystery
When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.
